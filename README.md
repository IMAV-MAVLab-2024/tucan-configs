# tucan-configs

A centralised place to keep config files for the TUCAN tema of the IMAV 2024 indoor competition.

## MAVLink router

1. Copy the config file to the correct directory:


```sh
sudo cp mavlink-router.conf /etc/mavlink-router/main.conf
```


## PX4-config

The config for the PX4 is saved in the px4_config.params file, you can simply load this file by connecting the Pixracer/Pixhawk FCU to a PC with USB, starting QGroundControl and going to:
Vehicle setup -> Parameters -> Tools -> Load from file..., and select the .params file. The main changes involve setting the baud rates on TEL2 and GPS1 correctly to interface with the companion computer.


## Enabling serial ports

On the Orange Pi version of Ubuntu 22.04 with the 6.1 kernel, 
```sh
sudo orangepi-config
```
Go to hardware and enable the uart0-m2 and uart1-m1 and save.

And to enable the camera use:
```sh
sudo systemctl disable docker.socket docker.service containerd.service
```

## Install Zenoh bridge on the drone

```sh
echo "deb [trusted=yes] https://download.eclipse.org/zenoh/debian-repo/ /" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update
sudo apt install zenoh-bridge-ros2dds
```

## Configure Environment Variables
1. Open the environemnt variable file in the editor:
```sh
sudo nano /etc/environment
```

2. Add the following lines:
```sh
ROS_DOMAIN_ID=74
```


## Optional: Receive
Currently, PX4 topics are not visible on the external device (f.e. laptop). I dont know why but it is not that important.

1. Install tailscale and add the drone to your network

2. Install zenoh bridge on laptop

```sh
echo "deb [trusted=yes] https://download.eclipse.org/zenoh/debian-repo/ /" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update
sudo apt install zenoh-bridge-ros2dds
```

3. Optionally onnect to the drones Wifi-AP
```sh
SSID: tucan
password: imav2024
```

3. Start zenoh brdige on the laptop by running (or using the drones tailscale i√º)
```sh
zenoh-bridge-ros2dds -e tcp/100.102.129.108:7447
```

5. Make sure the ROS_DOMAIN_ID environment variable on your laptop does **NOT** match the drone (74). By default it is 0, so not changing it should be fine.

5. And then in a terminal window on your laptop with the environment variables set run the following command.
```sh
ros2 topic list
```
